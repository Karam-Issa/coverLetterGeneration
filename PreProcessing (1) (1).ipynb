        "TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a numerical statistic widely used in natural language processing and information retrieval to evaluate the importance of words within a document relative to a larger collection of documents, known as a corpus. The process begins with the calculation of term frequency (TF), representing how often a specific word appears in a given document. However, to avoid giving too much weight to commonly occurring words, the inverse document frequency (IDF) is then computed. IDF measures the rarity of a word across the entire corpus, emphasizing terms that are unique or distinctive to a particular document.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TF-IDF score is obtained by multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency. A high TF-IDF score indicates that a word is both frequent within a document and rare in the corpus, suggesting its significance in characterizing the content of that document.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of extracting top keywords per description, TF-IDF serves as a valuable tool. By applying TF-IDF to preprocessed text data, we can generate a matrix where each row corresponds to a document (in this case, a job description) and each column represents a unique term in the entire corpus. The TF-IDF values in this matrix quantify the importance of each term within each document. To identify the top keywords, we sort these values for each document and select the terms with the highest TF-IDF scores. This process allows us to pinpoint the words that contribute the most to the uniqueness and significance of each job description, facilitating the extraction of key information such as job titles, company names, and other relevant details."
